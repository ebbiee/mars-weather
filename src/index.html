            <p class="desp">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than
                only
                Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
                atmosphere, and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of
                iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. It also
                has
                two small and irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos.
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also
                a
                dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more
                active
                in the past.
      
      
                Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers
                to
                roam the alien landscape.
      
                NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter
                (Ingenuity)
                exploring the surface of Mars.
      
                Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world – touched down on Mars on
                Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers). The Ingenuity
                helicopter rode to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance.
      
                Perseverance is one of three spacecraft that arrived at Mars in 2021. The Hope orbiter from the United Arab
                Emirates arrived on Feb. 9, 2021. China’s Tianwen-1 mission arrived on Feb. 10, 2021, and includes an orbiter,
                a
                lander, and a rover. Europe and India also have spacecraft studying Mars from orbit.</p>
